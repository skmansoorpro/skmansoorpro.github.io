<!-- There are different ways of selecting elements in the DOM (type, id or class name). 
The `select’ option provides an efficient and compact way to select/update elements in the DOM.
For example, change all ‘paragraphs’ with ‘class name’ of ‘test’ to ‘blue’ or select a specific element by its ‘id’-->

<script src="https://d3js.org/d3.v7.min.js"></script>
<style>
  .test {
    color: "blue";
  }
</style>
<p class="test">First paragraph</p>
<p>Second paragraph</p>
<p class="test2">Third paragraph</p>
<script>
  d3.selectAll(".test").style("color", "red"); //overwrites and selects all classes with the name test and changes their style//
</script>
