/*Exercise 24: What is the output for the example above (and why)?

Type of returned function is:  function
DV/Lab2/Exercise24_Lab2.html:11
(3) [16.2, 34.4, 5.2]
here the interpolation is happening between 20 and 1;40 and 12; 4 and 10.
So when we mention the t value as 0.2, what this means is for the value 20 to reach 1, we are incrementing 20% step.
So a reduction of 20% in 20 means we get 16.2
